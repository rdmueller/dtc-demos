= docToolchain Demos

All demos are organized in folders.
Each folder has its own docToolchain instance.

The demos are optimized to be used with https://gitpod.io[gitpod].
Just fork the repository and prepend `https://gitpod.io#` to the URL of your repository to get a webbased instance of VS Code.

For each demo, it makes sense to start a local webserver to see results:

[source, bash]
----
python -m http.server 8000
